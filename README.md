## 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on creating a **comprehensive Bank Loan Report** to monitor and assess the bank's lending activities and portfolio performance.  

By analyzing key loan-related metrics over time, the report enables **data-driven decision-making**, tracks the **overall health of the loan portfolio**, and identifies **critical trends** that inform future lending strategies and risk management.

The final output is an **interactive dashboard built using Power BI**, designed for executive review and operational oversight.

## 🎯 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The report tracks the following essential metrics to measure lending activity and risk:

| **Metric** | **Category** |
|-------------|--------------|
| Total Loan Application | Volume |
| Total Funded Amount | Capital Deployed |
| Total Amount Received | Collection Performance |
| Average Interest Rate | Cost of Capital |
| Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) | Risk Assessment |
| Good Loan / Bad Loan | Portfolio Health (Classification) |

## 📊 Rationale for Analysis

Analyzing bank loan data is crucial for maintaining financial stability and maximizing profitability.  
This report provides the necessary insights for:

- **Risk Assessment:** Evaluating the probability of default for new and existing loans.  
- **Decision-Making:** Setting appropriate interest rates, loan amounts, and approval criteria.  
- **Portfolio Management:** Identifying segments with high risk or high performance for strategic adjustments.  
- **Credit Risk Management:** Implementing models to minimize losses from non-performing loans.  
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Ensuring adherence to financial regulations and reporting standards.
